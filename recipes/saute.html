<h3>Light summer dish with simple Steps</h3>
<p>Easy and tasty. I added shredded fresh basil at the end for even more summery flavor. I also used only half the butter called for in the recipe--still plenty buttery. Delicious side dish (served it w quesadillas but I could see it as a side for any number of main dishes).</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
       <li> ¼ cup butter</li>
       <li> ½ small white onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>3 small zucchinis, diced</li>
        <li>3 ears corn, husks and silk removed</li>
        <li>sea salt to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
    </ul>
<h4> Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Cook and stir onion in the melted butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Cut kernels from the ears of corn. Add zucchini and corn; cook and stir until zucchini is tender, about 8 minutes. Season with sea salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve</li>
