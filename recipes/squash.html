<h3>Set some of that abundant summer squash aside for the winter months with this awesome pickled squash recipe. </h3>
<p>This recipe is very similar to one that I use to make bread and butter cucumber pickles every summer. It's delicious. I've given several jars away already. It made 6 full pints, although I may have had closer to 3 pounds of squash. Because I knew I had more squash than the recipe calls for, I increased the sugar and vinegar proportionately. We'll be happy to have this in the cellar all winter. Thanks for the recipe.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
       <li> ¼ cup salt</li>
       <li> 2 ½ pounds young yellow squash and zucchini, sliced into rounds</li>
       <li> 1 green bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips</li>
       <li>2 small onions, thinly sliced</li>
       <li>2 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
       <li>2 cups distilled white vinegar</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons mustard seed</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon celery seed </li>
    </ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large non-aluminum pot, combine the squash, bell pepper, and onions. Cover with salt, and let stand for 2 hours to release the liquids. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Just before the 2 hours are up, combine the sugar, vinegar, mustard seed, turmeric and celery seed in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Drain the salty liquid from the vegetables. Pour the spice brine over the vegetables, and let stand for 2 more hours.
        <li>Bring to a boil once again, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Ladle into 1 pint sterile jars, filling with the liquid to within 1/4 inch of the top. Wipe rims with a clean towel, and run a thin spatula around the inside of the jar to remove air bubbles. Seal with lids and rings. Process for 10 minutes in a simmering water bath to seal completely.</li>
